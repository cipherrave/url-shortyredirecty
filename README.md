# url-shortyredirecty
## A simple web url-shortening service made by yours truly.

## What is this?
Exercise in creating a backend for a mini URL SHORTENING service. Made during Adnexio's Software Engineering Conversion course as part of the monthly project.
The backend uses Node.js, PostgreSQL for user verification, link id creation and redirecting.
Used Insomnia to access the api. Also has HTML page for simple welcome page and 404 error page in case redirecting does not work.

## How to run?
